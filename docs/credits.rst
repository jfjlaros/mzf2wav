Original author, maintainer: Jeroen F.J. Laros.

The author would like to acknowledge Karl-Heinz Mau for:

- Testing the Windows program and giving feedback.
- Hosting_ the project.

And Ricky El-Qasem for:

- MZF2WAVGUI_, a graphical user interface for this project.
- Making a nice tutorial_ on how to use this software to directly connect to
  an MZ.

The *turbo loader* routine is copied from the related DOS utility TransManger_,
which in turn is based on Miroslav Nemecek's SHARPEXE_ utility. He got the
routine from the native program `Turbo Copy`_ (authors unknown). Highly similar
routines were found in FSTLOAD2_ and FSTLOAD3_ (authors unknown), so the exact
origin of this routine is unknown at the moment of this writing.
